# GiriÅŸ

Hugging Face kursuna hoÅŸ geldiniz! Bu bÃ¶lÃ¼mde kursta kullanacaÄŸÄ±mÄ±z Ã§alÄ±ÅŸma ortamÄ±nÄ± kuracaÄŸÄ±z. EÄŸer kursa yeni baÅŸlÄ±yorsanÄ±z, Ã¶ncelikle [1. bÃ¶lÃ¼me](/course/chapter1) bakmanÄ±zÄ±, sonra da geri gelip ortamÄ±nÄ±zÄ± kurmanÄ±zÄ± Ã¶neririz. BÃ¶ylelikle kodlarÄ± kendi baÅŸÄ±nÄ±za deneyimleyebilirsiniz.

Bu kursta kullanacaÄŸÄ±mÄ±z bÃ¼tÃ¼n kÃ¼tÃ¼phaneler Python package'Ä± olarak indirilebilir, bu yÃ¼zden burada Python ortamÄ±nÄ±n kurulumunu ve lazÄ±m olacak kÃ¼tÃ¼phaneleri indirmeyi gÃ¶stereceÄŸiz.

Ä°ki farklÄ± yol gÃ¶stereceÄŸiz Colab defterleri ve Python sanal ortamÄ±. Size en uygun olanÄ± seÃ§ebilirsiniz. Yeni baÅŸlayanlarÄ±n Colab defteri kullanmasÄ±nÄ± tavsiye ederiz.

Kursta Windows sistemi kullanmÄ±yoruz bu yÃ¼zden eÄŸer Windows kullanÄ±yorsanÄ±z Colab kullanmanÄ±z daha iyi olacaktÄ±r. EÄŸer herhangi bir Linux daÄŸÄ±tÄ±mÄ± ya da macOS kullanÄ±yorsanÄ±z iki yÃ¶ntemi de tercih edebilirsiniz. 

Kurs genel olarak Hugging Face Ã¼zerinden gidiyor. EÄŸer hesabÄ±nÄ±z yoksa [buradan hesap aÃ§abilirsiniz](https://huggingface.co/join). 

## Google Colab defteri kullanmak

Colab defteri kullanmak aÃ§Ä±k ara en kolay kurulum. TarayÄ±cÄ±nÄ±zda bir defter aÃ§Ä±n ve hemen kodlamaya baÅŸlayÄ±n! 

EÄŸer Colab kullanmayÄ± bilmiyorsanÄ±z bu [Ä°ngilizce tutorialÄ±](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) takip edebilirsiniz. Colab TPU ya da GPU gibi bazÄ± hÄ±zlandÄ±rÄ±cÄ± donanÄ±mlarÄ± kullanmanÄ±za izin verir. Ãœstelik kÃ¼Ã§Ã¼k iÅŸlemler iÃ§in bunlar Ã¼cretsiz!

Colab kullanÄ±mÄ±nda kendinizi rahat hissettikten sonra yeni bir defter oluÅŸturun ve kuruluma baÅŸlayÄ±n:

</div>

The next step is to install the libraries that we'll be using in this course. We'll use `pip` for the installation, which is the package manager for Python. In notebooks, you can run system commands by preceding them with the `!` character, so you can install the ğŸ¤— Transformers library as follows:

```
!pip install transformers
```

You can make sure the package was correctly installed by importing it within your Python runtime:

```
import transformers
```

<div class="flex justify-center">

</div>

This installs a very light version of ğŸ¤— Transformers. In particular, no specific machine learning frameworks (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) are installed. Since we'll be using a lot of different features of the library, we recommend installing the development version, which comes with all the required dependencies for pretty much any imaginable use case:

```
!pip install transformers[sentencepiece]
```

This will take a bit of time, but then you'll be ready to go for the rest of the course!

## Using a Python virtual environment

If you prefer to use a Python virtual environment, the first step is to install Python on your system. We recommend following [this guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) to get started.

Once you have Python installed, you should be able to run Python commands in your terminal. You can start by running the following command to ensure that it is correctly installed before proceeding to the next steps: `python --version`. This should print out the Python version now available on your system.

When running a Python command in your terminal, such as `python --version`, you should think of the program running your command as the "main" Python on your system. We recommend keeping this main installation free of any packages, and using it to create separate environments for each application you work on â€” this way, each application can have its own dependencies and packages, and you won't need to worry about potential compatibility issues with other applications.

In Python this is done with [*virtual environments*](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html), which are self-contained directory trees that each contain a Python installation with a particular Python version alongside all the packages the application needs. Creating such a virtual environment can be done with a number of different tools, but we'll use the official Python package for that purpose, which is called [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv).

First, create the directory you'd like your application to live in â€” for example, you might want to make a new directory called *transformers-course* at the root of your home directory:

```
mkdir ~/transformers-course
cd ~/transformers-course
```

From inside this directory, create a virtual environment using the Python `venv` module:

```
python -m venv .env
```

You should now have a directory called *.env* in your otherwise empty folder:

```
ls -a
```

```out
.      ..    .env
```

You can jump in and out of your virtual environment with the `activate` and `deactivate` scripts:

```
# Activate the virtual environment
source .env/bin/activate

# Deactivate the virtual environment
source .env/bin/deactivate
```

You can make sure that the environment is activated by running the `which python` command: if it points to the virtual environment, then you have successfully activated it!

```
which python
```

```out
/home/<user>/transformers-course/.env/bin/python
```

### Installing dependencies

As in the previous section on using Google Colab instances, you'll now need to install the packages required to continue. Again, you can install the development version of ğŸ¤— Transformers using the `pip` package manager:

```
pip install "transformers[sentencepiece]"
```

You're now all set up and ready to go!
