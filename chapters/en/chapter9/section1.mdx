In this chapter we will be learning about the quickest and easiest way to build a demo for your machine learning model. Why build a demo in the first place? Demos allow:

More precisely, in this chapter you will learn:

- Model developers to easily present their work to a wide audience
- Increase reproducibility of machine learning research
- Diverse users to more easily identify and debug failure points of models

Check out the [Keras Org] (https://huggingface.co/keras-io) on Hugging Face for some examples of what a machine learning demo looks like.
