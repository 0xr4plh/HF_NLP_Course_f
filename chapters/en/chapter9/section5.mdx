### Adding more content to your gradio interface:
  - Now you might notice that our interface looks too basic and plain. How can we add more context about our machine learning model? We can use the parameters below:
      - **title** *(str)* - a title for the interface; if provided, appears above the input and output components.
      - **description** *(str)* - a description for the interface; if provided, appears above the input and output components.
      - **article** *(str)* - an expanded article explaining the interface; if provided, appears below the input and output components. Accepts Markdown and HTML content
      - **theme** *(str)* - Theme to use - one of `default`, `huggingface`, `grass`, `peach`. Add `dark-` prefix, e.g. `dark-peach` for dark theme (or just `dark` for the default dark theme).
      - **examples** *(Union[List[List[Any]], str])* - sample inputs for the function; if provided, appears below the UI components and can be used to populate the interface. Should be nested list, in which the outer list consists of samples and each inner list consists of an input corresponding to each input component. A string path to a directory of examples can also be provided. If there are multiple input components and a directory is provided, a log.csv file must be present in the directory to link corresponding inputs.
        
      ```python
      gradio.Interface(self, fn, inputs=None, outputs=None, examples=None, theme=None, title=None, description=None, article=None)
      ```
        
    - Using these options, we end up with a more complete interface like the one below ([try model here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/BlendGAN))
