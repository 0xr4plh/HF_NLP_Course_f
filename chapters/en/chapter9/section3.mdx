### Understanding the `Interface` class:
  - `fn` the core prediction function that is wrapped by the gradio interface
  - `inputs` the input component type(s). Gradio provides out of the box components e.g. `image` or `audio` (**[see docs for complete list](https://gradio.app/docs)**)
  - `outputs` the output component type(s) e.g. `image`
    or `label`(**[see docs for complete list](https://gradio.app/docs)**)
  - `launch` launches the web server that serves the UI for the interface
      - Here are the most important parameters for launch() you should know:
          - **inline** *(bool)* - whether to display in the interface inline on python notebooks.
          - **inbrowser** *(bool)* - whether to automatically launch the interface in a new tab on the default browser.
          - **share** *(bool)* - whether to create a publicly shareable link from your computer for the interface.
          - **debug** *(bool)* - if True, and the interface was launched from Google Colab, prints the errors in the cell output.
          - **auth** *(Callable, Union[Tuple[str, str], List[Tuple[str, str]]])* - If provided, username and password (or list of username-password tuples) required to access interface. Can also provide function that takes username and password and returns True if valid login.
          - More details in the docs [here](https://gradio.app/docs/#launch)
  
### Sharing Gradio Interfaces
  - Now that we have a working demo of our machine learning model, let's learn how to easily share a link to our interface
  - Interfaces can be easily shared publicly by setting `share=True` in the `launch()` method.
        
    ```
    gr.Interface(classify_image, "image", "label").launch(share=True)
    ```
        
  - This generates a public, shareable link that you can send to anybody! When you send this link, the user on the other side can try out the model in their browser. Because the processing happens on your device (as long as your device stays on!), you don't have to worry about any packaging any dependencies. If you're working out of a Google colab notebook, a share link is always automatically created. It usually looks something like this: **XXXXX.gradio.app**. Although the link is served through a gradio link, we are only a proxy for your local server, and do not store any data sent through the interfaces.
  - Keep in mind, however, that these links are publicly accessible, meaning that anyone can use your model for prediction! Therefore, make sure not to expose any sensitive information through the functions you write, or allow any critical changes to occur on your device. If you set `share=False` (the default), only a local link is created, which can be shared by **[port-forwarding](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/example)** with specific users.
