Let's test what you learned in this chapter!

### 1. What use can you use a gradio demo to do?

<Question
	hydrate-props={{ choices: [
        {
			text: "Create a demo for your machine learning model",
			explain: "Of course! With a few lines of python code you can generate a demo for your ML model using our library of pre-built components.",
			correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "Share your machine learning model with others",
			explain: "Good choice! Using the share=True parameter in the launch method, you can generate a share link to send to anyone.",
            correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "Debug your model",
			explain: "Correct! One advantage of a gradio demo is being able to test your model with real data which you can change and observe the model's predictions change in real time, helping you debug your model.",
			correct: true
		},
		{
			text: "Train your model",
			explain: "Gradio is designed to be used for model inference, AFTER your model is trained.",
		}
	]}}
/>

### 2. Gradio ONLY works with pytorch models

<Question
	hydrate-props={{ choices: [
        {
			text: "True",
			explain: "Gradio does work with pytorch models, but also works for any type of machine learning model!"
        },
        {
			text: "False",
			explain: "Correct! Gradio is model agnostic, meaning you can create a demo for any type of machine learning model.",
			correct: true
        } 
	]}}
/>

### 3. Which of the following does gradio integrate with?

<Question
	hydrate-props={{ choices: [
        {
			text: "Any python IDE",
			explain: "Of course! Gradio works great with your favorite IDE.",
            correct: true
        },
        {
			text: "Google Colab notebooks",
			explain: "Correct! You can create and launch a demo within your Google colab notebook.",
			correct: true
        },
        {
			text: "Jupyter notebooks",
			explain: "Good choice - You can create and launch a demo within your Jupyter notebook.",
			correct: true
        } 
	]}}
/>

### 4. Gradio is exclusive to NLP and Image based models

<Question
	hydrate-props={{ choices: [
        {
			text: "True",
			explain: "Gradio is model agnostic, and works with any data type. Gradio also supplies developers with a library of pre-built components for all data types."
        },
        {
			text: "False",
			explain: "Of course! You can use gradio for any type of machine learning model!",
            correct: true
        }
	]}}
/>

### 5. Which of the following features are supported by gradio?

<Question
	hydrate-props={{ choices: [
        {
			text: "Multiple inputs and outputs",
			explain: "Multiple inputs and outputs is possible with gradio. All you need to do is pass in a list of inputs and outputs to their corresponding parameters",
            correct: true
        },
        {
			text: "State for data persistance",
			explain: "Gradio is capable of adding state to your interface.",
			correct: true
        },
        {
			text: "Username and passwords authentication",
			explain: "Pass in a list of username/password tuples to the launch method to add authentication.",
			correct: true
        },
        {
			text: "Track who uses your gradio demo",
			explain: "Try again - Gradio does not supply developers analytics on who uses their demos."
        },
        {
			text: "Loading a model from Hugging Face's model hub or Hugging Face Spaces",
			explain: "Absolutely - load any Hugging Face model using the gr.Interface.load() method",
			correct: true
        }
	]}}
/>

### 6. Which of the following are valid ways of loading a Hugging Face model from hub or spaces?

<Question
	hydrate-props={{ choices: [
        {
			text: "gr.Interface.load('huggingface/{user}/{model_name}')",
			explain: "This is a valid method of loading a Hugging Face model",
            correct: true
        },
        {
			text: "gr.Interface.load('model/{user}/{model_name}')",
			explain: "This is a valid method of loading a Hugging Face model",
			correct: true
        },
        {
			text: "gr.Interface.load('{url}')",
			explain: "Try again -- you cannot load a model by supplying a url to the model."
        },
        {
			text: "gr.Interface.load('spaces/{user}/{model_name}')",
			explain: "This is a valid method of loading a Hugging Face model",
			correct: true
        }
	]}}
/>

### 7. Select all the steps necessary for adding State to your gradio interface

<Question
	hydrate-props={{ choices: [
        {
			text: "Pass in an extra parameter into your prediction function, which represents the state of the interface.",
			explain: "An extra parameter storing history or state of your interface is necessary.",
            correct: true
        },
        {
			text: "At the end of the prediction function, return the updated value of the state as an extra return value.",
			explain: "This history or state value needs to be returned by your function.",
            correct: true
        },
        {
			text: "Add the state input and state output components when creating your Interface",
			explain: "Gradio provides a state input and output component to persist data.",
            correct: true
        }
	]}}
/>
