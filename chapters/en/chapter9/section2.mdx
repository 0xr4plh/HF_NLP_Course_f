First things first. Let's install `gradio`! Since it is a python package, simply run

```
$ pip install gradio
```

You can run `gradio` anywhere, from your favorite Python IDE to a jupyter notebooks or even in Google Colab.
So install `gradio` wherever you run Python!

Let's get started with a simple “Hello World” example to get familiar with the gradio API:

```py
import gradio as gr

def greet(name):
    return "Hello " + name

gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs="text", outputs="text").launch()
```

Let's walk through the code above:

- First, we define our a function, *any function*. In this case it is a simple function that adds "Hello" before your name. In a more typical example, this function would call a model to make a prediction on an input and return the output.
- Then, we create a gradio interface with three parameters, the first being the prediction function, and the other two being the input and output components we would like. In our case, both components are simple text boxes. 
- We then call the `launch()` method on the `Interface` that we created. 

If you run this code, the interface below will appear automatically within a Jupyter/Colab notebook, or pop in a browser on **[http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860/)** if running from a script.


Try using this GUI right now with your own inputs!

With just a few lines of code, you can create a simple interface that allows you to call any function with any kind of inputs. In this section, we've started with a 
simple textbox, but in the next section, we'll cover other kinds of inputs and outputs.

### Let's Apply It!

We'll build a simple interface that allows you to demo a **text-generation** model like GPT-2.
