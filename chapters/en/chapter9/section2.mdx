Let's start by installing `gradio`! Since it is a python package, simply run

`$ pip install gradio `

You can run `gradio` anywhere, from your favorite Python IDE to a jupyter notebooks or even in Google Colab.
So install `gradio` wherever you run Python!

Let's get started with a simple “Hello World” example to get familiar with the gradio syntax:

```py
import gradio as gr


def greet(name):
    return "Hello " + name


gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs="text", outputs="text").launch()
```

Let's walk through the code above:

- First, we define our a function, *any function*. In this case it is a simple function that adds "Hello" before your name. In a more typical example, this function would *call a model to make a prediction* on an input and return the output.
- Then, we create a gradio `Interface` with three parameters, the first being the prediction function, and the other two being the type of input and output components we would like. In our case, both components are simple text boxes. 
- We then call the `launch()` method on the `Interface` that we created. 

If you run this code, the interface below will appear automatically within a Jupyter/Colab notebook, or pop in a browser on **[http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860/)** if running from a script.

Try using this GUI right now with your own name or other input!

You'll notice that in this GUI, `gradio` automatically inferred the name of the input parameter (`name`)
and applied it as a label on top of the textbox. What if you'd like to change that?
Or if you'd like to customize the textbox in some other way? In that case, you can 
instantiate a class object representing the input component. 

Take a look at the example below:

```py
import gradio as gr


def greet(name):
    return "Hello " + name


# We instantiate the Textbox class
textbox = gr.inputs.Textbox(label="Type your name here:", placeholder="John Doe", lines=2)

gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs=textbox, outputs="text").launch()
```

Here, we've created an input textbox with a label, a placeholder, and a set number of lines.
You could do the same for the output textbox, but we'll leave that for now.

We've seen that with just a few lines of code, `gradio` lets you create a simple interface around any function 
with any kind of inputs or outputs. In this section, we've started with a 
simple textbox, but in the next section, we'll cover other kinds of inputs and outputs.

## ✏️ Let's apply it!

We'll build a simple interface that allows you to demo a **text-generation** model like GPT-2. 

We'll load our text generation model using the the `pipeline` abstraction from the `transformers` library. 
If you need a quick refresher, you can go back to [that section in Chapter 1](/course/chapter1/3#text-generation).   

First, we define a prediction function that takes in a text prompt and returns the text completion

```py
from transformers import pipeline

model = pipeline("text-generation")


def predict(prompt):
    completion = model(prompt)[0]["generated_text"]
    return completion
```

This function completes prompts that you reply. You can run it with your own input prompts to see how it works. Here are a couple of examples (you might get a different completion):

```
predict("My favorite programming language is")
```

```
>> My favorite programming language is Haskell. I really enjoyed the Haskell language, but it doesn't have all the features that can be applied to any other language. For example, all it does is compile to a byte array.
```

Now, we can create the Interface for it immediately.

```py
import gradio as gr

gr.Interface(fn=predict, inputs="text", outputs="text").launch()
```


That's it! You can now use this interface to generate text using the GPT-2 model as shown below.

Keep going to see how to build other kinds of demos with `gradio`.
