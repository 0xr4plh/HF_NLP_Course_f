Gradio is a python package and can run anywhere from your favorite IDE to Google Colab and Jupyter notebooks.
Let's get started with a simple “Hello World” example to get familiar with the gradio API:

```python
!pip install gradio

# Define a simple "Hello World" function
def greet(name):
    return "Hello " + name

# Write 2 lines of Python to create a simple Gradio Interface
import gradio as gr

gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs="text", outputs="text").launch();
```

- Let's walk through the code above:
    - First, we pip install the gradio python package
    - Next, we define our “prediction” function. In this case it is a simple function that outputs “Hello” + your name. When working with machine learning models, this function would be written to call predict on the model itself and return the output.
    - Lastly, we create a gradio interface with three parameters, the first being the prediction function, and the other two being the input and output components. In our case both components are simple text boxes. We then call launch on our interface.
    - The interface below will appear automatically within a Jupyter/Colab notebook, or pop in a browser on **[http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860/)** if running from a script.
