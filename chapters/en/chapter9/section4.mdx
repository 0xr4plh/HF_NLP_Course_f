### Image Input and Output Example:

As mentioned earlier, gradio provides many different inputs and outputs. So let's try building an interface that works with images.

- In this example, we're building an image-to-image function. When using the `Image` component, your function will receive a numpy array of your specified size, with the shape `(width, height, 3)`, where the last dimension represents the RGB values. We'll return an image as well in the form of a numpy array.
```
import numpy as np
import gradio as gr

def sepia(input_img):
  sepia_filter = np.array(
    [[0.393, 0.769, 0.189], [0.349, 0.686, 0.168], [0.272, 0.534, 0.131]]
  )
  sepia_img = input_img.dot(sepia_filter.T)
  sepia_img /= sepia_img.max()
  return sepia_img

  iface = gr.Interface(sepia, gr.inputs.Image(shape=(200, 200)), "image")
  iface.launch()
```
- The code above will produce an interface like the one below:

- Additionally, our Image input interface comes with an 'edit' button which opens tools for cropping, flipping, rotating, drawing over, and applying filters to images. Try playing around with it; we've found that manipulating images in this way will often reveal hidden flaws in a model.

### Multiple Inputs and Outputs:

- Let's say we had a much more complex function, with multiple inputs and outputs. In the example below, we have a function that takes a string, boolean, and number, and returns a string and number. Take a look how we pass a list of input and output components.

```
import gradio as gr

def greet(name, is_morning, temperature):
  salutation = "Good morning" if is_morning else "Good evening"
  greeting = "%s %s. It is %s degrees today" % (salutation, name, temperature)
  celsius = (temperature - 32) * 5 / 9
  return greeting, round(celsius, 2)

iface = gr.Interface(
  fn=greet,
  inputs=["text", "checkbox", gr.inputs.Slider(0, 100)],
  outputs=["text", "number"],
)
iface.launch()
```
